.8 - Correctly check for passed in column names in build_table
     as an array ref
     
   ! Completely changed the interface.  Create your own object
     that is a Class::DBI::Plugin::HTML object.  This provides
     for setting of parameters in a safer OO way as well as
     via arguments for each method.
     
   + Added alternate row background color, default is grey
   
   + Added accessor methods to set various attributes used
     across several methods.  Not all items have an accessor.
     
   ! Renamed attributes that are passed to methods to match
     the accessor methods that have been added.
     
   + Modified (most of) the documentation to reflect the changes
     outlined above.
     
   + Added dependency on Class::DBI::Plugin::AbstractCount to
     speed up the string_filter_navigation method
     
   + Added additional notes in pod to clarify a couple of
     points
     
   + Added link to example web page: http://cdbi.gina.net/cdbitest.pl

.7 o Implemented Class::DBI::Plugin as the base class instead
     of Exporting the methods
     
   + named arguement for url query string to be:
     -query_string across all methods
   
   + changed to -page_name from -script across all methods to
     indicate which page (cgi script) is to be used in url
     creation
     
   + added -form_tag_attributes to build_form methods allowed
     attributes
   
   + added -hidden attributes to the build_form methods allowed
     attributes
     
   o expanded the internal function '_value_link' to handle the
     new BEGINSWITH ENDSWITH and CONTAINS filters.
   
   + added new method 'string_filter_navigation'
   
   + html_table_navigation now has three possible outputs
      1) block (prev,next)
      2) google (1,2,3..)
      3) both block and google

   + added new method form_select to generate HTML select form
     elements
     
   + updated documentation to reflect additional methods and
     method changes
      
.6 o Modified the build_table method to allow for multiple
     scenarios regarding table records, giving more control
     back to the end user with regard to return method.
     
   + Added new collasping/expanding table code. This modification 
     allows for the dynamic navigation of records via a browser
     based the content of specific fields.  See docs for more info

     to (reduce|increase) confusion.

     information to clarify some of the points.

   - Removed url_and_where_statement method and created url_query
     and search_ref in its place
     
   + Added url_query method - creates the query string of the URL
     based on passed in parameters
   
   + Added search_ref method - creates generates the hash for the
     AbstractSearch portion
     
   + Made the ONLY and LIKE filters built in tools and accesible
     via assigning a value of "only" or "like" to a field name
     
   + Added a parameter to the  build_table, called 'script', used
     to set the script name for links created by the built in link
